# ODIN PROJECT ETCH A SKETCH

This project is Part of the Odin Project Path of Web Development for specialization on Frontend with Ruby On Rails. 

## Specifications:

- Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
- Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your HTML file!
- It’s best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div (which can go directly in your HTML).
- You need make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). This is a perfect opportunity to apply what you have learned about flexbox.
- Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
- Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad. 
- Push your project to GitHub!

## What I learned

I learned more about responsive webpages as well as the use of Java script to alter the document. I know that is more common to use a framework, however is important to learn the basis before starting to touch any kind of sophisticate tool.
